The first uses regex to find regions, and then you can use scopes to qualify the regions before applying the replace.\n\n\n    \n// Required parameters:\n\n    \n//     find:    Regex description of what you would like to target.\n\n    \n//\n\n    \n// Optional parameters:\n\n    \n//     replace:      description of what you would like to replace target with.\n\n    \n//                   Variables are okay for non-literal searches and are done by escaping\n\n    \n//                   the selection number \\\\1 etc.  Default value is \n (empty string)\n\n    \n//     literal:      Boolean setting to define whether the find and replace is literal or not.\n\n    \n//                   Default is false.\n\n    \n//     greedy:       Boolean setting to define whether search is greedy or not.

One way is to create a command in the command palette by editing/creating a \nDefault.sublime-commands\n in your \nUser\n folder and then adding your command(s).\n\n\nBasic replacement command:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_trailing_spaces\n]}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChained replacements in one command:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Remove HTML Comments and Trailing Spaces\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_html_comments\n,\n \nremove_trailing_spaces\n]}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also bind a replacement command to a shortcut.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nkeys\n:\n \n[\nctrl+shift+t\n],\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_trailing_spaces\n]}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Without Replacing\n\n\nIf you would simply like to view what the sequence would find without replacing, you can construct a command to highlight targets without replacing them (each pass could affect the end result, but this just shows all passes without predicting the replacements).\n\n\nJust add the \nfind_only\n argument and set it to true.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_trailing_spaces\n],\n \nfind_only\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA prompt will appear allowing you to replace the highlighted regions.  Regions will be cleared on cancel.\n\n\nIf for any reason the highlights do not get cleared, you can simply run the \nRegReplace: Clear Highlights\n command from the command palette.\n\n\nHighlight color and style can be changed in the settings file.\n\n\nOverride Actions\n\n\nIf instead of replacing you would like to do something else, you can override the action. Actions are defined in commands by setting the \naction\n parameter.  Some actions may require additional parameters be set in the \noptions\n parameter.  See examples below.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Fold HTML Comments\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_html_comments\n],\n \naction\n:\n \nfold\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Unfold HTML Comments\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_html_comments\n],\n \naction\n:\n \nunfold\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Mark Example\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nexample\n],\n\n            \naction\n:\n \nmark\n,\n\n            \noptions\n:\n \n{\nkey\n:\n \nname\n,\n \nscope\n:\n \ninvalid\n,\n \nstyle\n:\n \nunderline\n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Unmark Example\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\n\n            \naction\n:\n \nunmark\n,\n\n            \noptions\n:\n \n{\nkey\n:\n \nname\n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported override actions:\n\n\n\n\nfold\n\n\nunfold\n\n\nmark\n\n\nunmark\n\n\nselect\n\n\n\n\nFold Override\n\n\naction\n:\n \nfold\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis action folds the given find target.

In this case, you can use the multi-pass option.\n\n\nMulti-pass cannot be paired with override actions (it will be ignored), but it can be paired with \nfind_only\n.  Multi-pass will sweep the file repeatedly until all instances are found and replaced.  To protect against a poorly constructed multi-pass regex looping forever, there is a default max sweep threshold that will cause the sequence to kick out if it is reached.  This threshold can be tweaked in the settings file.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nexample\n],\n \nmulti_pass\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace Only Under Selection(s)\n\n\nSometimes you only want to search under selections.  This can be done by enabling the \nselection_only\n setting in the settings file.  By enabling this setting, regex targets will be limited to the current selection if and only if a selection exists.  Auto replace/highlight on save events ignore this setting.  If you have a command that you wish to ignore this setting, just set the \nno_selection\n argument to \ntrue\n.  Highlight style will be forced to underline selections if \nfind_only\n is set to ensure they will show up.\n\n\n    \n// Ignore \nselection_only\n setting\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nexample\n],\n \nmulti_pass\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n \nno_selection\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Regex on Entire File Buffer when Using Selections\n\n\nSometimes you might have a regex chain that lends itself better to performing the regex on the entire file buffer and then pick the matches under the selections as opposed to the default behavior of applying the regex directly to the selection buffer.  To do this, you can use the option \nregex_full_file_with_selections\n.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nRemove: All Comments\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nreplacements\n:\n \n[\n\n                \nremove_comments\n,\n \nremove_trailing_spaces\n,\n\n                \nremove_excessive_newlines\n,\n \nensure_newline_at_file_end\n\n            \n],\n\n            \nfind_only\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n            \nregex_full_file_with_selections\n:\n \ntrue\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply Regex Right Before File Save Event\n\n\nIf you want to automatically apply a sequence right before a file saves, you can define sequences in the \nreg_replace.sublime-settings\n file.  Each \non save\n sequence will be applied to the files you specify by file patterns or file regex.  Also, you must have \non_save\n set to \ntrue\n.  You can also just highlight, fold, or unfold by regex by adding the \naction\n: \nmark\n key/value pair (supported options are \nmark\n, \nfold\n, and \nunfold\n). Both types can be used at the same time. Actions are performed after replacements.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n    \n// If on_save is true, RegReplace will search through the file patterns listed below right before a file is saved,\n\n    \n// if the file name matches a file pattern, the sequence will be applied before the file is saved.\n\n    \n// RegReplace will apply all sequences that apply to a given file in the order they appear below.\n\n    \non_save\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n    \n// Highlight visual settings\n\n    \non_save_highlight_scope\n:\n \ninvalid\n,\n\n    \non_save_highlight_style\n:\n \noutline\n,\n\n\n    \non_save_sequences\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n// An example on_save event that removes dangling commas from json files\n\n        \n// - file_regex: an array of regex strings that must match the file for the sequence to be applied\n\n        \n// - case: regex case sensitivity (true|false) false is default (this setting is optional)\n\n        \n// - file_pattern: an array of file patterns that must match for the sequence to be applied\n\n        \n// - sequence: an array of replacement definitions to be applied on saving the file\n\n        \n// - multi_pass: perform multiple passes on file to catch all regex instances\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nfile_regex\n:\n \n[\n.*\\\\.sublime-(settings|commands|menu|keymap|mousemap|theme|build|project|completions|commands)\n],\n\n            \nfile_pattern\n:\n \n[\n*.json\n],\n\n            \nsequence\n:\n \n[\nremove_json_dangling_commas\n]\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n// An example on_save_sequence that targets all files and highlights trailing spaces\n\n        \n// - file_pattern: an array of file patterns that must match for the sequence to be applied\n\n        \n// - sequence: an array of replacement definitions to be applied on saving the file\n\n        \n// - action: (mark|fold|unfold) instead of replace\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nfile_pattern\n:\n \n[\n*\n],\n\n            \nsequence\n:\n \n[\nremove_trailing_spaces\n],\n\n            \naction\n:\n \nmark\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n],\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Replace Plugins\n\n\nThere are times that a simple regular expression and replace is not enough.  Since RegReplace uses Python\ns re regex engine, we can use python code to intercept the replace and do more complex things via a plugin.\n\n\nIn this example we are going to search for dates with the form YYYYMMDD and increment them by one day.\n\n\nBelow is the regex rule; notice we have defined a plugin to replace.  Plugins are defined as if you were importing a module in python.  So in this example, we are loading it from the \nUser\n package. You do not need an \n__init__.py\n file in \nrr_modules\n folder; it is recommended to not use one as Sublime shouldn\nt bother loading these files as RegReplace will load them when needed.\n\n\ndate_up\n:\n \n{\n\n    \nfind\n:\n \n(?P\nyear\n\\\\d{4})(?P\nmonth\n\\\\d{2})(?P\nday\n\\\\d{2})\n,\n\n    \nplugin\n:\n \nUser.rr_modules.date_up\n\n    \n// \nargs\n: {\nsome_plugin_arguments\n: \nif_desired\n}  \n== optional plugin arguments\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we can define the command that will utilize the regex rule:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReplace: Date Up\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\ndate_up\n],\n \nfind_only\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we can provide the plugin.  RegReplace will load the plugin and look for a function called \nreplace\n.  \nreplace\n takes a python re match object, and any arguments you want to feed it.  Arguments are defined in the regex rule as shown above.\n\n\nSHORT_MONTH\n \n=\n \n30\n\n\nLONG_MONTH\n \n=\n \n31\n\n\nFEB_MONTH\n \n=\n \n28\n\n\nFEB_LEAP_MONTH\n \n=\n \n29\n\n\n\nJAN\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nFEB\n \n=\n \n2\n\n\nMAR\n \n=\n \n3\n\n\nAPR\n \n=\n \n4\n\n\nMAY\n \n=\n \n5\n\n\nJUN\n \n=\n \n6\n\n\nJUL\n \n=\n \n7\n\n\nAUG\n \n=\n \n8\n\n\nSEP\n \n=\n \n9\n\n\nOCT\n \n=\n \n10\n\n\nNOV\n \n=\n \n11\n\n\nDEC\n \n=\n \n12\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nis_leap_year\n(\nyear\n):\n\n    \nreturn\n \n((\nyear\n \n%\n \n4\n \n==\n \n0\n)\n \nand\n \n(\nyear\n \n%\n \n100\n \n!=\n \n0\n))\n \nor\n \n(\nyear\n \n%\n \n400\n \n==\n \n0\n)\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \ndays_in_months\n(\nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n):\n\n    \ndays\n \n=\n \nLONG_MONTH\n\n    \nif\n \nmonth\n \n==\n \nFEB\n:\n\n        \ndays\n \n=\n \nFEB_LEAP_MONTH\n \nif\n \nis_leap_year\n(\nyear\n)\n \nelse\n \nFEB_MONTH\n\n    \nelif\n \nmonth\n \nin\n \n[\nSEP\n,\n \nAPR\n,\n \nJUN\n,\n \nNOV\n]:\n\n        \ndays\n \n=\n \nSHORT_MONTH\n\n    \nreturn\n \ndays\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nincrement_by_day\n(\nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n):\n\n    \nmdays\n \n=\n \ndays_in_months\n(\nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nday\n \n==\n \nmdays\n:\n\n        \nday\n \n=\n \n1\n\n        \nif\n \nmonth\n \n==\n \nDEC\n:\n\n            \nmonth\n \n=\n \nJAN\n\n            \nyear\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n        \nelse\n:\n\n            \nmonth\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n    \nelse\n:\n\n        \nday\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nreplace\n(\nm\n):\n\n    \ng\n \n=\n \nm\n.\ngroupdict\n()\n\n    \nyear\n \n=\n \nint\n(\ng\n[\nyear\n]\n.\nlstrip\n(\n0\n))\n\n    \nmonth\n \n=\n \nint\n(\ng\n[\nmonth\n]\n.\nlstrip\n(\n0\n))\n\n    \nday\n \n=\n \nint\n(\ng\n[\nday\n]\n.\nlstrip\n(\n0\n))\n\n\n    \nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n \n=\n \nincrement_by_day\n(\nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n)\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \n%04d%02d%02d\n \n%\n \n(\nyear\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nday\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is some text to test the example on:\n\n\n# Test 1: 20140228\n# Test 2: 20141231\n# Test 3: 20140101\n\n\n\n\n\nRegReplace comes with a very simple example you can test with found at \n/Packages/RegReplace/rr_modules/example.py\n.  Imported with \nRegReplace.rr_modules.example\n.\n\n\nExtended Back References\n\n\nRegReplace uses a special wrapper around Python\ns re library called backrefs.  Backrefs was written specifically for RegReplace and adds various additional backrefs that are known to some regex engins, but not to Python\ns re.  Backrefs adds: \n\\p\n, \n\\P\n, \n\\u\n, \n\\U\n, \n\\l\n, \n\\L\n, \n\\Q\n or \n\\E\n (though \n\\u\n and \n\\U\n are replaced with \n\\c\n and \n\\C\n).  You can enable extended back references in the settings file:\n\n\n    \n// Use extended back references\n\n    \nextended_back_references\n:\n \ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen enabled, you can apply the back references to your search and/or replace patterns as you would other back references:\n\n\n    \ntest_case\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nfind\n:\n \n([a-z])(?P\nsomegroup\n[a-z]*)((?:_[a-z]+)+)\n,\n\n        \nreplace\n:\n \n\\\\c\\\\1\\\\L\\\\g\nsomegroup\n\\\\E\\\\C\\\\g\n3\n\\\\E\n,\n\n        \ngreedy\n:\n \ntrue\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about the backrefs\n features in the \nbackrefs documentation\n.\n\n\nGetting the Latest Backrefs\n\n\nIt is not always clear when Package Control updates dependencies.  So to force dependency updates, you can run Package Control\ns \nSatisfy Dependencies\n command which will update to the latest release.\n\n\nUsing Backrefs in RegReplace Plugin\n\n\nYou can import backrefs into a RegReplace plugin:\n\n\nfrom\n \nbackrefs\n \nas\n \nbre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackrefs does provide a wrapper for all of re\ns normal functions such as \nmatch\n, \nsub\n, etc., but is recommended to pre-compile your search patterns \nand\n your replace patterns for the best performance; especially if you plan on reusing the same pattern multiple times.  As re does cache a certain amount of the non-compiled calls you will be spared from some of the performance hit, but backrefs does not cache the pre-processing of search and replace patterns.\n\n\nTo use pre-compiled functions, you compile the search pattern with \ncompile_search\n.  If you want to take advantage of replace backrefs, you need to compile the replace pattern as well.  Notice the compiled pattern is fed into the replace pattern; you can feed the replace compiler the string representation of the search pattern as well, but the compiled pattern will be faster and is the recommended way.\n\n\npattern\n \n=\n \nbre\n.\ncompile_search\n(\nr\nsomepattern\n,\n \nflags\n)\n\n\nreplace\n \n=\n \nbre\n.\ncompile_replace\n(\npattern\n,\n \nr\n\\1 some replace pattern\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you can use the complied search pattern and replace\n\n\ntext\n \n=\n \npattern\n.\nsub\n(\nreplace\n,\n \nr\nsometext\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nm\n \n=\n \npattern\n.\nmatch\n(\nr\nsometext\n)\n\n\nif\n \nm\n:\n\n    \ntext\n \n=\n \nreplace\n(\nm\n)\n  \n# similar to m.expand(template)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the non-compiled search/replace functions, you call them just them as you would in re; the names are the same.

Example:       // If on_save is true, RegReplace will search through the file patterns listed below right before a file is saved, \n     // if the file name matches a file pattern, the sequence will be applied before the file is saved. \n     // RegReplace will apply all sequences that apply to a given file in the order they appear below. \n     on_save :   true , \n\n     // Highlight visual settings \n     on_save_highlight_scope :   invalid , \n     on_save_highlight_style :   outline , \n\n     on_save_sequences :   [ \n         // An example on_save event that removes dangling commas from json files \n         // - file_regex: an array of regex strings that must match the file for the sequence to be applied \n         // - case: regex case sensitivity (true|false) false is default (this setting is optional) \n         // - file_pattern: an array of file patterns that must match for the sequence to be applied \n         // - sequence: an array of replacement definitions to be applied on saving the file \n         // - multi_pass: perform multiple passes on file to catch all regex instances \n         { \n             file_regex :   [ .*\\\\.sublime-(settings|commands|menu|keymap|mousemap|theme|build|project|completions|commands) ], \n             file_pattern :   [ *.json ], \n             sequence :   [ remove_json_dangling_commas ] \n         }, \n         // An example on_save_sequence that targets all files and highlights trailing spaces \n         // - file_pattern: an array of file patterns that must match for the sequence to be applied \n         // - sequence: an array of replacement definitions to be applied on saving the file \n         // - action: (mark|fold|unfold) instead of replace \n         { \n             file_pattern :   [ * ], \n             sequence :   [ remove_trailing_spaces ], \n             action :   mark \n         } \n     ],",

            "text": "There are times that a simple regular expression and replace is not enough.  Since RegReplace uses Python s re regex engine, we can use python code to intercept the replace and do more complex things via a plugin.  In this example we are going to search for dates with the form YYYYMMDD and increment them by one day.  Below is the regex rule; notice we have defined a plugin to replace.  Plugins are defined as if you were importing a module in python.  So in this example, we are loading it from the  User  package. You do not need an  __init__.py  file in  rr_modules  folder; it is recommended to not use one as Sublime shouldn t bother loading these files as RegReplace will load them when needed.  date_up :   { \n     find :   (?P year \\\\d{4})(?P month \\\\d{2})(?P day \\\\d{2}) , \n     plugin :   User.rr_modules.date_up \n     //  args : { some_plugin_arguments :  if_desired }   == optional plugin arguments  }   Next we can define the command that will utilize the regex rule:       { \n         caption :   Replace: Date Up , \n         command :   reg_replace , \n         args :   { replacements :   [ date_up ],   find_only :   true } \n     },   Lastly, we can provide the plugin.  RegReplace will load the plugin and look for a function called  replace .   replace  takes a python re match object, and any arguments you want to feed it.  Arguments are defined in the regex rule as shown above.

            "text": "RegReplace uses a special wrapper around Python s re library called backrefs.  Backrefs was written specifically for RegReplace and adds various additional backrefs that are known to some regex engins, but not to Python s re.  Backrefs adds:  \\p ,  \\P ,  \\u ,  \\U ,  \\l ,  \\L ,  \\Q  or  \\E  (though  \\u  and  \\U  are replaced with  \\c  and  \\C ).  You can enable extended back references in the settings file:       // Use extended back references \n     extended_back_references :   true   When enabled, you can apply the back references to your search and/or replace patterns as you would other back references:       test_case :   { \n         find :   ([a-z])(?P somegroup [a-z]*)((?:_[a-z]+)+) , \n         replace :   \\\\c\\\\1\\\\L\\\\g somegroup \\\\E\\\\C\\\\g 3 \\\\E , \n         greedy :   true \n     }   You can read more about the backrefs  features in the  backrefs documentation .  Getting the Latest Backrefs  It is not always clear when Package Control updates dependencies.  So to force dependency updates, you can run Package Control s  Satisfy Dependencies  command which will update to the latest release.  Using Backrefs in RegReplace Plugin  You can import backrefs into a RegReplace plugin:  from   backrefs   as   bre   Backrefs does provide a wrapper for all of re s normal functions such as  match ,  sub , etc., but is recommended to pre-compile your search patterns  and  your replace patterns for the best performance; especially if you plan on reusing the same pattern multiple times.  As re does cache a certain amount of the non-compiled calls you will be spared from some of the performance hit, but backrefs does not cache the pre-processing of search and replace patterns.  To use pre-compiled functions, you compile the search pattern with  compile_search .  If you want to take advantage of replace backrefs, you need to compile the replace pattern as well.  Notice the compiled pattern is fed into the replace pattern; you can feed the replace compiler the string representation of the search pattern as well, but the compiled pattern will be faster and is the recommended way.  pattern   =   bre . compile_search ( r somepattern ,   flags )  replace   =   bre . compile_replace ( pattern ,   r \\1 some replace pattern )   Then you can use the complied search pattern and replace  text   =   pattern . sub ( replace ,   r sometext )   or  m   =   pattern . match ( r sometext )  if   m : \n     text   =   replace ( m )    # similar to m.expand(template)   To use the non-compiled search/replace functions, you call them just them as you would in re; the names are the same.  Methods like  sub  and  subn  will compile the replace pattern on the fly if given a string.  for   m   in   bre . finditer ( r somepattern ,   some text ,   bre . UNICODE   |   bre . DOTALL ): \n     # do something   If you want to replace without compiling, you can use the  expand  method.  m   =   bre . match ( r sometext )  if   m : \n     text   =   bre . expand ( m ,   r replace pattern )",
