            "text": "User Guide\n\n\nConfiguring and using RegReplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular Expression Engine\n\n\nRemember that the regular expression engine that is used is Python\ns \nre\n, not Sublime\ns internal regular expression engine.  If enabling \nextended_back_references\n, additional syntax is added which is covered in the \nbackrefs documentation\n.\n\n\nTo enable such features as case insensitivity or dotall, see \nre\ns documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\nCreate Find and Replace Sequences\n\n\nTo use, replacements must be defined in the \nreg_replace_rules.sublime-settings\n file.\n\n\nThere are two types of rules that can be created: scope rules (with optional scope qualifiers) or scope searches that apply regex to the targeted scopes.  We will call these \nregex\n and \nscope regex\n rules respectively.\n\n\nRegex\n rules use regex to find regions, and then you can use scopes to qualify the regions before applying the replace.  These rules can use the following options:\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n    ###### Regex with optional scope qualifiers. ######\n\n\n    - find (required)\n\n\n    - replace\n\n\n    - literal\n\n\n    - literal_ignorecase\n\n\n    - greedy\n\n\n    - scope_filter\n\n\n    - plugin\n\n\n    - args\n\n\n    */\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nreplacements\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nhtml5_remove_deprecated_type_attr\n:\n \n{\n\n                \nfind\n:\n \n(?i)(\n(style|script)[^\n]*)\\\\stype=(\\\n|\n)text/(css|javascript)(\\\n|\n)([^\n]*\n)\n,\n\n                \nreplace\n:\n \n\\\\1\\\\6\n,\n\n                \ngreedy\n:\n \ntrue\n\n            \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second kind of rule is the \nscope regex\n which allows you to search for a scope type and then apply regex to the regions to filter the matches and make replacements.\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n    ###### Scope search with regex applied to scope region. ######\n\n\n    - scope (required)\n\n\n    - find\n\n\n    - replace\n\n\n    - literal\n\n\n    - literal_ignorecase\n\n\n    - greedy\n\n\n    - greedy_scope\n\n\n    - multi_pass\n\n\n    - plugn\n\n\n    - args\n\n\n    */\n\n\n    \n{\n\n            \nreplacements\n:\n \n{\n\n                \nremove_comments\n:\n \n{\n\n                    \nscope\n:\n \ncomment\n,\n\n                    \nfind\n \n:\n \n(([^\\\\n\\\\r]*)(\\\\r\\\\n|\\\\n))*([^\\\\n\\\\r]+)\n,\n\n                    \nreplace\n:\n \n,\n\n                    \ngreedy\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n                    \ngreedy_scope\n:\n \ntrue\n\n                \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA description of all the options is found below:\n\n\n    name:               (str): Rule name.

Use (?s) for dotall.\n                        See https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/re.html for more info on regex flags.\n                        Required unless \nscope\n is defined.\n\n    replace:            (str - default=r\n\\0\n): Replace pattern.\n\n    literal:            (bool - default=False): Preform a non-regex, literal search and replace.\n\n    literal_ignorecase: (bool - default=False): Ignore case when \nliteral\n is true.\n\n    scope:              (str): Scope to search for and to apply optional regex to.\n                        Required unless \nfind\n is defined.\n\n    scope_filter:       ([str] - default=[]): An array of scope qualifiers for the match.\n                        Only used when \nscope\n is not defined.\n\n                        - Any instance of scope qualifies match: scope.name\n                        - Entire match of scope qualifies match: !scope.name\n                        - Any instance of scope disqualifies match: -scope.name\n                        - Entire match of scope disqualifies match: -!scope.name\n\n    greedy:             (bool - default=True): Apply action to all instances (find all).\n                        Used when \nfind\n is defined.\n\n    greedy_scope:       (bool - default=True): Find all the scopes specified by \nscope.\n\n\n    multi_pass:         (bool - default=False): Perform multiple sweeps on the scope region to find\n                        and replace all instances of the regex when regex cannot be formatted to find\n                        all instances.  Since a replace can change a scope, this can be useful.\n\n    plugin:             (str): Define replace plugin for more advanced replace logic.\n                        Only used for regex replaces and replace.\n\n    args:               (dict): Arguments for \nplugin\n.\n                        Only used for regex replaces and replace.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have replacements defined, there are a number of ways you can run a sequence.  One way is to create a command in the command palette by editing/creating a \nDefault.sublime-commands\n in your \nUser\n folder and then adding your command(s).\n\n\nBasic replacement command:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_trailing_spaces\n]}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChained replacements in one command:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Remove HTML Comments and Trailing Spaces\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_html_comments\n,\n \nremove_trailing_spaces\n]}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also bind a replacement command to a shortcut.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nkeys\n:\n \n[\nctrl+shift+t\n],\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_trailing_spaces\n]}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Better Way To Create Regex Rules\n\n\nRecently a new feature was added that allows the editing of the regex rules to be done in a Python syntax highlighted panel.  This allows for a less cumbersome editing experience.  Users can even split their regex on multiple lines and add comments which will all be preserved for the next time the rule is viewed.\n\n\nWhile in the edit panel, you can press \nctrl\n + \ns\n on Windows/Linux (or \nsuper\n + \ns\n on OSX) and the rule will be saved back to the settings file.  On save, the regex is compiled to test if it is valid; if it fails, you should be alerted and the save will be canceled.\n\n\nTo edit, insert, or delete rules, you can use the following command palette commands:\n\n\n\n\nRegReplace: Edit Regular Expression Rule\n\n\nRegReplace: Create New Regular Expression Rule\n\n\nRegReplace: Delete Regular Expression Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also test the regex from the edit panel.  At the bottom of the panel, you should see the \ntest\n variable which will allow you to configure a sequence to run from the panel.  Once configured, you can press \nctrl\n + \nf\n on Windows/Linux (or \nsuper\n + \nf\n on OSX) to execute.  Keep in mind, you can run the current rule sequenced together with others in the test configuration to test how it plays with other rules.  \ntest\n is not saved with the other settings, but is only good for the current session.\n\n\n# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n# test: Here you can setup a test command.  This is not saved and is just used for this session.\n\n\n#     - replacements ([str]): A list of regex rules to sequence together.\n\n\n#     - find_only (bool): Highlight current find results and prompt for action.\n\n\n#     - action (str): Apply the given action (fold|unfold|mark|unmark|select).\n\n\n#       This overrides the default replace action.\n\n\n#     - options (dict): optional parameters for actions (see documentation for more info).\n\n\n#         - key (str): Unique name for highlighted region.\n\n\n#         - scope (str - default=\ninvalid\n): Scope name to use as teh color.\n\n\n#         - style (str - default=\noutline\n): Highlight style (solid|underline|outline).\n\n\n#     - multi_pass (bool): Repeatedly sweep with sequence to find all instances.\n\n\n#     - no_selection (bool): Overrides the \nselection_only\n setting and forces no selections.\n\n\n#     - regex_full_file_with_selections (bool): Apply regex search to full file then apply\n\n\n#       action to results under selections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on how the test command was configured, it may cause the panel to close, or you might accidentally close it by pressing \nesc\n or running some other command.  When closed, the currently opened rule is not lost and can be brought back by running the command palette command \nRegReplace: Show Edit Panel\n (the command will only work if the panel has been opened at least once).  You can also use the panel icon in the bottom left hand corner of the Sublime Text window (only on later versions of Sublime Text 3).\n\n\nView Without Replacing\n\n\nIf you would simply like to view what the sequence would find without replacing, you can construct a command to highlight targets without replacing them (each pass could affect the end result, but this just shows all passes without predicting the replacements).\n\n\nJust add the \nfind_only\n argument and set it to true.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_trailing_spaces\n],\n \nfind_only\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA prompt will appear allowing you to replace the highlighted regions.  Regions will be cleared on cancel.\n\n\nIf for any reason the highlights do not get cleared, you can simply run the \nRegReplace: Clear Highlights\n command from the command palette.\n\n\nHighlight color and style can be changed in the settings file.\n\n\nOverride Actions\n\n\nIf instead of replacing you would like to do something else, you can override the action. Actions are defined in commands by setting the \naction\n parameter.  Some actions may require additional parameters be set in the \noptions\n parameter.  See examples below.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Fold HTML Comments\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_html_comments\n],\n \naction\n:\n \nfold\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Unfold HTML Comments\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nremove_html_comments\n],\n \naction\n:\n \nunfold\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Mark Example\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nexample\n],\n\n            \naction\n:\n \nmark\n,\n\n            \noptions\n:\n \n{\nkey\n:\n \nname\n,\n \nscope\n:\n \ninvalid\n,\n \nstyle\n:\n \nunderline\n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Unmark Example\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\n\n            \naction\n:\n \nunmark\n,\n\n            \noptions\n:\n \n{\nkey\n:\n \nname\n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported override actions:\n\n\n\n\nfold\n\n\nunfold\n\n\nmark\n\n\nunmark\n\n\nselect\n\n\n\n\nFold Override\n\n\naction\n:\n \nfold\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis action folds the given find target.

In this case, you can use the multi-pass option.  This option will cause the entire sequence to repeatedly executed until all instances are found and replaced.  To protect against a poorly constructed multi-pass regex looping forever, there is a default max sweep threshold that will cause the sequence to kick out if it is reached.  This threshold can be tweaked in the settings file.\n\n\nMulti-pass is used in replaces and cannot be paired with override actions (it will be ignored), but it can be paired with \nfind_only\n as \nfind_only\n allows you to initiate a replace.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nexample\n],\n \nmulti_pass\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace Only Under Selection(s)\n\n\nSometimes you only want to search under selections.  This can be done by enabling the \nselection_only\n setting in the settings file.  By enabling this setting, regex targets will be limited to the current selection if and only if a selection exists.  Auto replace/highlight on save events ignore this setting.  If you have a command that you wish to ignore this setting, just set the \nno_selection\n argument to \ntrue\n.  Highlight style will be forced to underline selections if \nfind_only\n is set to ensure they will show up.\n\n\n    \n// Ignore \nselection_only\n setting\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReg Replace: Remove Trailing Spaces\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\nexample\n],\n \nmulti_pass\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n \nno_selection\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Regex on Entire File Buffer when Using Selections\n\n\nWhen \nselection_only\n is enabled, you might have a regex chain that lends itself better to performing the regex on the entire file buffer and then pick the matches under the selections as opposed to the default behavior of applying the regex directly to the selection buffer.  To do this, you can use the option \nregex_full_file_with_selections\n.\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nRemove: All Comments\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nreplacements\n:\n \n[\n\n                \nremove_comments\n,\n \nremove_trailing_spaces\n,\n\n                \nremove_excessive_newlines\n,\n \nensure_newline_at_file_end\n\n            \n],\n\n            \nfind_only\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n            \nregex_full_file_with_selections\n:\n \ntrue\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply Regex Right Before File Save Event\n\n\nIf you want to automatically apply a sequence right before a file saves, you can define sequences in the \nreg_replace.sublime-settings\n file.  Each \non save\n sequence will be applied to the files you specify by file patterns or file regex.  Also, you must have \non_save\n set to \ntrue\n.  You can also just highlight, fold, or unfold by regex by adding the \naction\n: \nmark\n key/value pair (supported options are \nmark\n, \nfold\n, and \nunfold\n). Both types can be used at the same time. Actions are performed after replacements.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n    \n// If on_save is true, RegReplace will search through the file patterns listed below right before a file is saved,\n\n    \n// if the file name matches a file pattern, the sequence will be applied before the file is saved.\n\n    \n// RegReplace will apply all sequences that apply to a given file in the order they appear below.\n\n    \non_save\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n    \n// Highlight visual settings\n\n    \non_save_highlight_scope\n:\n \ninvalid\n,\n\n    \non_save_highlight_style\n:\n \noutline\n,\n\n\n    \non_save_sequences\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n// An example on_save event that removes dangling commas from json files\n\n        \n// - file_regex: an array of regex strings that must match the file for the sequence to be applied\n\n        \n// - case: regex case sensitivity (true|false) false is default (this setting is optional)\n\n        \n//   See https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/re.html for more information on Python\ns re.\n\n        \n// - file_pattern: an array of file patterns that must match for the sequence to be applied\n\n        \n// - sequence: an array of replacement definitions to be applied on saving the file\n\n        \n// - multi_pass: perform multiple passes on file to catch all regex instances\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nfile_regex\n:\n \n[\n(?i).*\\\\.sublime-(settings|commands|menu|keymap|mousemap|theme|build|project|completions|commands)\n],\n\n            \nfile_pattern\n:\n \n[\n*.json\n],\n\n            \nsequence\n:\n \n[\nremove_json_dangling_commas\n]\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n// An example on_save_sequence that targets all files and highlights trailing spaces\n\n        \n// - file_pattern: an array of file patterns that must match for the sequence to be applied\n\n        \n// - sequence: an array of replacement definitions to be applied on saving the file\n\n        \n// - action: (mark|fold|unfold) instead of replace\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nfile_pattern\n:\n \n[\n*\n],\n\n            \nsequence\n:\n \n[\nremove_trailing_spaces\n],\n\n            \naction\n:\n \nmark\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n],\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Replace Plugins\n\n\nThere are times that a simple regular expression and replace is not enough.  Since RegReplace uses Python\ns re regex engine, we can use python code to intercept the replace and do more complex things via a plugin.  Because this uses Python\ns re, this will only be applied when doing regex searches (not literal searches).\n\n\nIn this example we are going to search for dates with the form YYYYMMDD and increment them by one day.\n\n\nBelow is the regex rule; notice we have defined a plugin to replace.  Plugins are defined as if you were importing a module in python.  So in this example, we are loading it from the \nUser\n package. You do not need an \n__init__.py\n file in \nrr_modules\n folder; it is recommended to not use one as Sublime shouldn\nt bother loading these files as RegReplace will load them when needed.\n\n\ndate_up\n:\n \n{\n\n    \nfind\n:\n \n(?P\nyear\n\\\\d{4})(?P\nmonth\n\\\\d{2})(?P\nday\n\\\\d{2})\n,\n\n    \nplugin\n:\n \nUser.rr_modules.date_up\n\n    \n// \nargs\n: {\nsome_plugin_arguments\n: \nif_desired\n}  \n== optional plugin arguments\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we can define the command that will utilize the regex rule:\n\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nReplace: Date Up\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nreg_replace\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n \n{\nreplacements\n:\n \n[\ndate_up\n],\n \nfind_only\n:\n \ntrue\n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we can provide the plugin.  RegReplace will load the plugin and look for a function called \nreplace\n.  \nreplace\n takes a python re match object, and any arguments you want to feed it.  Arguments are defined in the regex rule as shown above.\n\n\nSHORT_MONTH\n \n=\n \n30\n\n\nLONG_MONTH\n \n=\n \n31\n\n\nFEB_MONTH\n \n=\n \n28\n\n\nFEB_LEAP_MONTH\n \n=\n \n29\n\n\n\nJAN\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nFEB\n \n=\n \n2\n\n\nMAR\n \n=\n \n3\n\n\nAPR\n \n=\n \n4\n\n\nMAY\n \n=\n \n5\n\n\nJUN\n \n=\n \n6\n\n\nJUL\n \n=\n \n7\n\n\nAUG\n \n=\n \n8\n\n\nSEP\n \n=\n \n9\n\n\nOCT\n \n=\n \n10\n\n\nNOV\n \n=\n \n11\n\n\nDEC\n \n=\n \n12\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nis_leap_year\n(\nyear\n):\n\n    \nreturn\n \n((\nyear\n \n%\n \n4\n \n==\n \n0\n)\n \nand\n \n(\nyear\n \n%\n \n100\n \n!=\n \n0\n))\n \nor\n \n(\nyear\n \n%\n \n400\n \n==\n \n0\n)\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \ndays_in_months\n(\nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n):\n\n    \ndays\n \n=\n \nLONG_MONTH\n\n    \nif\n \nmonth\n \n==\n \nFEB\n:\n\n        \ndays\n \n=\n \nFEB_LEAP_MONTH\n \nif\n \nis_leap_year\n(\nyear\n)\n \nelse\n \nFEB_MONTH\n\n    \nelif\n \nmonth\n \nin\n \n[\nSEP\n,\n \nAPR\n,\n \nJUN\n,\n \nNOV\n]:\n\n        \ndays\n \n=\n \nSHORT_MONTH\n\n    \nreturn\n \ndays\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nincrement_by_day\n(\nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n):\n\n    \nmdays\n \n=\n \ndays_in_months\n(\nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nday\n \n==\n \nmdays\n:\n\n        \nday\n \n=\n \n1\n\n        \nif\n \nmonth\n \n==\n \nDEC\n:\n\n            \nmonth\n \n=\n \nJAN\n\n            \nyear\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n        \nelse\n:\n\n            \nmonth\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n    \nelse\n:\n\n        \nday\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nreplace\n(\nm\n):\n\n    \ng\n \n=\n \nm\n.\ngroupdict\n()\n\n    \nyear\n \n=\n \nint\n(\ng\n[\nyear\n]\n.\nlstrip\n(\n0\n))\n\n    \nmonth\n \n=\n \nint\n(\ng\n[\nmonth\n]\n.\nlstrip\n(\n0\n))\n\n    \nday\n \n=\n \nint\n(\ng\n[\nday\n]\n.\nlstrip\n(\n0\n))\n\n\n    \nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n \n=\n \nincrement_by_day\n(\nday\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nyear\n)\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \n%04d%02d%02d\n \n%\n \n(\nyear\n,\n \nmonth\n,\n \nday\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is some text to test the example on:\n\n\n# Test 1: 20140228\n# Test 2: 20141231\n# Test 3: 20140101\n\n\n\n\n\nRegReplace comes with a very simple example you can test with found at \n/Packages/RegReplace/rr_modules/example.py\n.  Imported with \nRegReplace.rr_modules.example\n.\n\n\nExtended Back References\n\n\nRegReplace uses a special wrapper around Python\ns re library called backrefs.  Backrefs was written specifically for RegReplace and adds various additional backrefs that are known to some regex engins, but not to Python\ns re.  Backrefs adds: \n\\p\n, \n\\P\n, \n\\u\n, \n\\U\n, \n\\l\n, \n\\L\n, \n\\Q\n or \n\\E\n (though \n\\u\n and \n\\U\n are replaced with \n\\c\n and \n\\C\n).  You can enable extended back references in the settings file:\n\n\n    \n// Use extended back references\n\n    \nextended_back_references\n:\n \ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen enabled, you can apply the back references to your search and/or replace patterns as you would other back references:\n\n\n    \ntest_case\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nfind\n:\n \n([a-z])(?P\nsomegroup\n[a-z]*)((?:_[a-z]+)+)\n,\n\n        \nreplace\n:\n \n\\\\c\\\\1\\\\L\\\\g\nsomegroup\n\\\\E\\\\C\\\\g\n3\n\\\\E\n,\n\n        \ngreedy\n:\n \ntrue\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about the backrefs\n features in the \nbackrefs documentation\n.\n\n\nGetting the Latest Backrefs\n\n\nIt is not always clear when Package Control updates dependencies.  So to force dependency updates, you can run Package Control\ns \nSatisfy Dependencies\n command which will update to the latest release.\n\n\nUsing Backrefs in RegReplace Plugin\n\n\nYou can import backrefs into a RegReplace plugin:\n\n\nfrom\n \nbackrefs\n \nas\n \nbre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackrefs does provide a wrapper for all of re\ns normal functions such as \nmatch\n, \nsub\n, etc., but is recommended to pre-compile your search patterns \nand\n your replace patterns for the best performance; especially if you plan on reusing the same pattern multiple times.  As re does cache a certain amount of the non-compiled calls you will be spared from some of the performance hit, but backrefs does not cache the pre-processing of search and replace patterns.\n\n\nTo use pre-compiled functions, you compile the search pattern with \ncompile_search\n.  If you want to take advantage of replace backrefs, you need to compile the replace pattern as well.  Notice the compiled pattern is fed into the replace pattern; you can feed the replace compiler the string representation of the search pattern as well, but the compiled pattern will be faster and is the recommended way.\n\n\npattern\n \n=\n \nbre\n.\ncompile_search\n(\nr\nsomepattern\n,\n \nflags\n)\n\n\nreplace\n \n=\n \nbre\n.\ncompile_replace\n(\npattern\n,\n \nr\n\\1 some replace pattern\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you can use the complied search pattern and replace\n\n\ntext\n \n=\n \npattern\n.\nsub\n(\nreplace\n,\n \nr\nsometext\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nm\n \n=\n \npattern\n.\nmatch\n(\nr\nsometext\n)\n\n\nif\n \nm\n:\n\n    \ntext\n \n=\n \nreplace\n(\nm\n)\n  \n# similar to m.expand(template)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the non-compiled search/replace functions, you call them just them as you would in re; the names are the same.

            "text": "Recently a new feature was added that allows the editing of the regex rules to be done in a Python syntax highlighted panel.  This allows for a less cumbersome editing experience.  Users can even split their regex on multiple lines and add comments which will all be preserved for the next time the rule is viewed.  While in the edit panel, you can press  ctrl  +  s  on Windows/Linux (or  super  +  s  on OSX) and the rule will be saved back to the settings file.  On save, the regex is compiled to test if it is valid; if it fails, you should be alerted and the save will be canceled.  To edit, insert, or delete rules, you can use the following command palette commands:   RegReplace: Edit Regular Expression Rule  RegReplace: Create New Regular Expression Rule  RegReplace: Delete Regular Expression Rule    You can also test the regex from the edit panel.  At the bottom of the panel, you should see the  test  variable which will allow you to configure a sequence to run from the panel.  Once configured, you can press  ctrl  +  f  on Windows/Linux (or  super  +  f  on OSX) to execute.  Keep in mind, you can run the current rule sequenced together with others in the test configuration to test how it plays with other rules.   test  is not saved with the other settings, but is only good for the current session.  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  # test: Here you can setup a test command.

Depending on how the test command was configured, it may cause the panel to close, or you might accidentally close it by pressing  esc  or running some other command.  When closed, the currently opened rule is not lost and can be brought back by running the command palette command  RegReplace: Show Edit Panel  (the command will only work if the panel has been opened at least once).

Since RegReplace uses Python s re regex engine, we can use python code to intercept the replace and do more complex things via a plugin.

In this example we are going to search for dates with the form YYYYMMDD and increment them by one day.  Below is the regex rule; notice we have defined a plugin to replace.  Plugins are defined as if you were importing a module in python.  So in this example, we are loading it from the  User  package. You do not need an  __init__.py  file in  rr_modules  folder; it is recommended to not use one as Sublime shouldn t bother loading these files as RegReplace will load them when needed.  date_up :   { \n     find :   (?P year \\\\d{4})(?P month \\\\d{2})(?P day \\\\d{2}) , \n     plugin :   User.rr_modules.date_up \n     //  args : { some_plugin_arguments :  if_desired }   == optional plugin arguments  }   Next we can define the command that will utilize the regex rule:       { \n         caption :   Replace: Date Up , \n         command :   reg_replace , \n         args :   { replacements :   [ date_up ],   find_only :   true } \n     },   Lastly, we can provide the plugin.

As re does cache a certain amount of the non-compiled calls you will be spared from some of the performance hit, but backrefs does not cache the pre-processing of search and replace patterns.  To use pre-compiled functions, you compile the search pattern with  compile_search .  If you want to take advantage of replace backrefs, you need to compile the replace pattern as well.  Notice the compiled pattern is fed into the replace pattern; you can feed the replace compiler the string representation of the search pattern as well, but the compiled pattern will be faster and is the recommended way.  pattern   =   bre . compile_search ( r somepattern ,   flags )  replace   =   bre . compile_replace ( pattern ,   r \\1 some replace pattern )   Then you can use the complied search pattern and replace  text   =   pattern . sub ( replace ,   r sometext )   or  m   =   pattern . match ( r sometext )  if   m : \n     text   =   replace ( m )    # similar to m.expand(template)   To use the non-compiled search/replace functions, you call them just them as you would in re; the names are the same.

You can post pictures, but if specific text or code is required to reproduce the issue, please provide the text in a plain text format for easy copy/paste.\n\n\n\n\nThe more info provided the greater the chance someone will take the time to answer, implement, or fix the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe prepared to answer questions and provide additional information if required.  Issues in which the creator refuses to respond to follow up questions will be marked as stale and closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewing Code\n\n\nTake part in reviewing pull requests and/or reviewing direct commits.  Make suggestions to improve the code and discuss solutions to overcome weakness in the algorithm.\n\n\nPull Requests\n\n\nPull requests are welcome, and if you plan on contributing directly to the code, there are a couple of things to be mindful of.\n\n\nContinuous integration tests on are run on all pull requests and commits via Travis CI.  When making a pull request, the tests will automatically be run, and the request must pass to be accepted.  You can (and should) run these tests before pull requesting.  If it is not possible to run these tests locally, they will be run when the pull request is made, but it is strongly suggested that requesters make an effort to verify before requesting to allow for a quick, smooth merge.\n\n\nFeel free to use a virtual environment if you are concerned about installing any of the Python packages.  In the future, I may use tox, but as I currently only test on Python 3.3, I wanted to keep things simple.\n\n\nRunning Validation Tests\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf you are running Sublime on a OSX or Linux/Unix system, you run all tests by by running the shell script (assuming you have installed your environment fulfills all requirements below):\n\n\nchmod +x run_tests.sh\n./run_tests.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of dependencies that must be present before running the tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs \nST3\n is the only current, actively supported version, Python 3.3 must be used to validate the tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit tests are run with \nnose\n.  You can install nose via:\n\n\npip install nose\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tests should be run from the root folder of the plugin by using the following command:\n\n\nnosetests .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed on the entire project with \nflake8\n, \nflake8-docstrings\n, and \npep8-naming\n.  These can be installed via:\n\n\npip install flake8\npip install flake8-docstrings\npip install pep8-naming\n\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed with the following command:\n\n\nflake8 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation Improvements\n\n\nA ton of time has been spent not only creating and supporting this plugin, but also spent making this documentation.  If you feel it is still lacking, show your appreciation for the plugin by helping to improve the documentation.  Help with documentation is always appreciated and can be done via pull requests.  There shouldn\nt be any need to run validation tests if only updating documentation.\n\n\nYou don\nt have to render the docs locally before pull requesting, but if you wish to, I currently use a combination of \nmkdocs\n with my own custom Python Markdown \nextensions\n to render the docs.  You can preview the docs if you install these two packages.  The command for previewing the docs is \nmkdocs serve\n from the root directory.",

Examples for reproducing the error.  You can post pictures, but if specific text or code is required to reproduce the issue, please provide the text in a plain text format for easy copy/paste.   The more info provided the greater the chance someone will take the time to answer, implement, or fix the issue.    Be prepared to answer questions and provide additional information if required.

Continuous integration tests on are run on all pull requests and commits via Travis CI.  When making a pull request, the tests will automatically be run, and the request must pass to be accepted.  You can (and should) run these tests before pull requesting.  If it is not possible to run these tests locally, they will be run when the pull request is made, but it is strongly suggested that requesters make an effort to verify before requesting to allow for a quick, smooth merge.  Feel free to use a virtual environment if you are concerned about installing any of the Python packages.  In the future, I may use tox, but as I currently only test on Python 3.3, I wanted to keep things simple.",

As  ST3  is the only current, actively supported version, Python 3.3 must be used to validate the tests.    Unit tests are run with  nose .  You can install nose via:  pip install nose  The tests should be run from the root folder of the plugin by using the following command:  nosetests .    Linting is performed on the entire project with  flake8 ,  flake8-docstrings , and  pep8-naming .  These can be installed via:  pip install flake8\npip install flake8-docstrings\npip install pep8-naming  Linting is performed with the following command:  flake8 .",

If you feel it is still lacking, show your appreciation for the plugin by helping to improve the documentation.  Help with documentation is always appreciated and can be done via pull requests.  There shouldn t be any need to run validation tests if only updating documentation.  You don t have to render the docs locally before pull requesting, but if you wish to, I currently use a combination of  mkdocs  with my own custom Python Markdown  extensions  to render the docs.  You can preview the docs if you install these two packages.  The command for previewing the docs is  mkdocs serve  from the root directory.",
